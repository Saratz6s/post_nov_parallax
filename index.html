        <h2>Parallax Effect</h2>
        <p>Parallax scrolling is a web design technique in which the website background moves at a slower pace than the
            foreground. This results in a 3D effect as visitors scroll down the site, adding a sense of depth and
            creating a more immersive browsing experience.


            Parallax is based on optical illusion. Since the human eye perceives objects that are close to us as larger
            than things farther away, we perceive distant objects as if they were moving more slowly.


            The illusion has been long adopted into parallax across different mediums, fostering a realistic effect. Its
            first use was in traditional animation, dating back to as early as Disney’s Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs,
            and in video games such as Super Mario.


            With advancements in CSS and HTML, parallax effects later evolved into the world of web design as we know it
            today.

            <h2>Nature</h2>
            <p>Everything we see around us constitutes nature, including the sun, the moon, trees, flowers, fruits,
                human beings, birds, animals, etc. In nature, everyone depends on one another to keep the ecosystem
                healthy. For survival, every creature is interrelated and reliant on one another. Humans, for example,
                rely on nature for their survival, and nature provides us with oxygen, food, water, shelter, medicines,
                and clothing, among other things. Many shades may be seen in nature, contributing to the planet’s
                beauty. Along with humans, animals and birds also find their habitat and means of survival in nature.
                Therefore, it is essential to take proper care of our nature to maintain a healthy life.</p>

                <p>Nature is the ultimate source of our living. Both living and non-living things include nature, and
                    everyone is interdependent, which helps maintain the ecosystem. Plants, animals, and humans all
                    depend on nature for their survival. It supplies oxygen, sunlight, soil, water, and other necessary
                    components. But deforestation has been the primary cause of global warming, destroying nature. In
                    addition to exploiting excessive natural resources, other industries pollute the environment with
                    toxic gases and chemicals. It is now essential to reduce biological damage, reuse things, and
                    recycle existing materials to create new ones. People from all over the world should join forces to
                    relieve pressure on the environment and restore its balance. It is now the essential aim to serve
                    nature with utmost care to save our nature from hazards and threats.</p>
